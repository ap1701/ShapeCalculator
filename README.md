# Shape Calculator
The Shape Calculator is a Java program that calculates the area, perimeter, and volume of various shapes based on user input. It uses object-oriented programming principles to create classes for each shape and interfaces for volume calculation.

## Usage
To use the Shape Calculator, run the ShapeCalculator class in a Java IDE or from the command line. The program will display a menu of shapes and prompt the user for input. Based on the user's selection, the program will calculate and display the shape's area, perimeter, and/or volume.

## Classes and Interfaces
The Shape Calculator consists of the following classes and interfaces:

* Shape (abstract class): Defines common properties and methods for all shapes, including showShape(), calculateShape(), and calculatePerimeter().
* Circle (class): Calculates the area and perimeter of a circle.
* Rectangle (class): Calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle.
* Square (class): Calculates the area and perimeter of a square.
* Sphere (class): Calculates the surface area and volume of a sphere.
* Cylinder (class): Calculates the surface area and volume of a cylinder.
* Pyramid (class): Calculates the surface area and volume of a pyramid.
* Volume (interface): Defines the calculateVolume() method for calculating the volume of a shape.
